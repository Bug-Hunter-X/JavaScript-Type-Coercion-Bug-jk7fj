This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion. The bug arises when adding a number and a string. JavaScript automatically converts the number to a string, resulting in string concatenation instead of the expected numerical addition. The solution involves using type checking or explicit type conversion to ensure that both operands are numbers before performing the addition.
